  annote =	 {The general expression for the exact forces on the
                  nuclei (negative derivatives of the total energy
                  with respect to the nuclear coordinates) is applied
                  for Hartree-Fock wavefunctions. It is suggested that
                  force constants should be calculated by
                  differentiating the forces numerically. This method,
                  called the force method, is numerically more
                  accurate and requires less computation than the
                  customary one of differentiating the energy
                  numerically twice. It permits the quick
                  determination of the equilibrium geometry by
                  relaxing the nuclear coordinates until the forces
                  vanish. The unreliability of the methods using the
                  Hellmann-Feynman forces is re-emphasized. The
                  question of which force constants can be best
                  calculated ab initio is discussed.}
