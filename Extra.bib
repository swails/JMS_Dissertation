                  for Hartree-Fock wavefunctions. It is suggested that
                  force constants should be calculated by
                  differentiating the forces numerically. This method,
                  called the force method, is numerically more
                  accurate and requires less computation than the
                  customary one of differentiating the energy
                  numerically twice. It permits the quick
                  determination of the equilibrium geometry by
                  relaxing the nuclear coordinates until the forces
                  vanish. The unreliability of the methods using the
                  Hellmann-Feynman forces is re-emphasized. The
                  question of which force constants can be best
                  calculated ab initio is discussed.}

                  studying the chemistry and physics of liquids.
                  Simulations allow us to develop models and to test
                  them against experimental data. They can be used to
                  evaluate approximate theories of liquids, and to
                  provide detailed information on the structure and
                  dynamics of model liquids at the molecular
                  level. This book is an introduction and practical
                  guide to the molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
                  methods.  The first four chapters describe these
                  methods in detail, and provide the essential
                  background in intermolecular forces and statistical
                  mechanics.  Chapters 5 and 6 emphasize the practical
                  aspects of writing efficient programs and analysing
                  the simulation results.  The remaining chapters
                  cover advanced techniques, non-equilibrium methods,
                  Brownian dynamics, quantum simulations, and some
                  important applications.  FORTRAN code is presented
                  in the text.}},

  abstract =	 {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used
                  to study protein motions at an atomic level of
                  detail, but they have been limited to time scales
                  shorter than those of many biologically critical
                  conformational changes. We examined two fundamental
                  processes in protein dynamics—protein folding and
                  conformational change within the folded state—by
                  means of extremely long all-atom MD simulations
                  conducted on a special-purpose machine. Equilibrium
                  simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple
                  folding and unfolding events that consistently
                  follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate
                  simulations of the protein’s constituent
                  substructures shed light on possible determinants of
                  this pathway. A 1-millisecond simulation of the
                  folded protein BPTI reveals a small number of
                  structurally distinct conformational states whose
                  reversible interconversion is slower than local
                  relaxations within those states by a factor of more
                  than 1000.},
