\chapter{FLEXIBLE TOOLS FOR AMBER SIMULATIONS}
\label{ch6}

In this chapter, I will describe the motivation behind creating several tools
to aid users in carrying out biomolecular simulations with the Amber programming
package as well as some details regarding their functionality and
implementation. During the course of my graduate studies, I wrote several tools
to aid in my work---some of which I polished and released with the Amber suite
of programs. The three I will describe in this chapter are \emph{MMPBSA.py},
\cite{MMPBSApy} \emph{ParmEd}, and \emph{update\_amber}.
