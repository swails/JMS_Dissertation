\section{Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formulations}

The \emph{Lagrangian} and \emph{Hamiltonian} formulations of classical
mechanics---shown in Eqs. \ref{eqA:Lagrangian} and \ref{eqA:Hamiltonian},
respectively---offer a more convenient formalism than the more popularly known
equations derived by Newton. \cite{CorbenClassicalMechanics} While Newton's
equations apply in three-dimensional Cartesian space, they are not generally
applicable to other coordinate systems (\eg polar and spherical-polar
coordinates) that may be a more natural way to express certain problems. For
instance, polar coordinates more naturally describe the mechanics of orbiting
bodies than standard Euclidean space.

\paragraph{Lagrangian Equation}

The Lagrangian function, $L = K - V$, where $K$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is
the potential energy, satisfies the Lagrangian equation (Eq.
\ref{eqA:Lagrangian}) for $m$ generalized coordinates ($q_m$). The advantage of
Eq. \ref{eqA:Lagrangian} is that it is derived without any assumption of a
specific coordinate system for $q_m$. Generalized velocities are the first
time-derivative of the generalized coordinates, $\dot q_m$. These generalized
velocities are used to define the kinetic energy in the familiar form $K = 1/2
\dot q_m ^ 2$.

Another advantage to the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics is that
the equations are still valid when subject to constraints on the dynamics of the
system (as long as there are fewer constraints than particles).
\cite{CorbenClassicalMechanics} This property is crucial for carrying out
constrained dynamics, such as those simulations employing the commonly-used
SHAKE, \cite{Ryckaert_JComputPhys_1977_v23_p327} RATTLE, \cite{Andersen1983} or
SETTLE \cite{Miyamoto_JComputChem_1992_v13_p952} algorithms, to name a few.

\begin{equation}
   \frac d {dt} \frac {\partial L} {\partial \dot q_m} - \frac {\partial L}
         {\partial q_m} = 0
   \label{eqA:Lagrangian}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the Lagrangian function mentioned above, $q_m$ are the generalized
coordinates of every particle in the system, and $\dot q_m$ are the set of
corresponding generalized velocities. When applying Eq. \ref{eqA:Lagrangian} to
a system in the standard Cartesian coordinates without constraints, the familiar
form of Newton's equations are recovered. \cite{CorbenClassicalMechanics}

\paragraph{Hamiltonian Equation}

The Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics builds on the strengths of
the Lagrangian formulation and provides a deeper insight into the physical
behavior of classical systems. Unlike the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian is defined
as the total energy of the system: $H = K + V$. The Lagrangian of the system,
$L = K - V$, plays an important part in Hamilton's formulation. The degrees of
freedom in Hamilton's equation (Eq. \ref{eqA:Hamiltonian}) are the generalized
coordinates $q_m$ as defined in the Lagrangian, and their conjugate momenta,
$p_m$. The generalized coordinates and momenta are said to be canonically
conjugate because they obey the relationship given in Eq. \ref{eqA:Hamiltonian}.
\cite{CorbenClassicalMechanics}

\begin{align}
   q_m & = \frac {\partial H} {\partial p_m} \nonumber \\
   p_m & = - \frac {\partial H} {\partial q_m}
   \label{eqA:Hamiltonian}
\end{align}

Now that a convenient formulation of the laws of classical dynamics are known, I
will shift the discussion toward techniques by which these equations are used to
integrate these second-order differential equations in typical molecular
dynamics simulations.

\section{Numerical Integration by Finite Difference Methods}

The equations of motion are second-order differential equations with respect to
the particle coordinates, since the force is proportional to the second
time-derivative (\ie the acceleration) of those particles. Due to the typical
size and complexity of the systems and their potentials studied in computational
chemistry, MD simulations require numerical integration of the second-order
differential equations of motion. In this section, I will describe two common
approaches to iteratively integrating Eqs. \ref{eqA:Lagrangian} and
\ref{eqA:Hamiltonian}---so-called \emph{predictor-corrector} methods and the
Verlet family of integrators.

\subsection{Predictor-corrector}

The predictor-corrector integrators are based on a simple Taylor-series
expansion of the coordinates. Knowing that the velocity and acceleration are the
first- and second-time derivatives of the particle positions, respectively, the
Taylor expansions of each of these quantities are given below.
\begin{align}
   \vec{r}_p (t_0 + \delta t) & = \vec{r}(t_0) + \delta t \, \vec{v}(t_0) +
         \delta t^2 \, \frac 1 2 \vec{a}(t_0) + \delta t^3 \, \frac 1 6 \frac
         {d^3\vec{r}(t)} {dt^3} + ... \nonumber \\
   \vec{v}_p (t_0 + \delta t) & = \vec{v}(t_0) + \delta t \, a(t) + \frac 1 2 
         \delta t^2 \, \frac {d^3\vec{r}(t)} {dt^3} + ...
   \label{eqA:Predictor} \\
   \vec{a}_p (t_0 + \delta t) & = \vec{a}(t_0) + \delta t \, \frac
         {d^3\vec{r}(t)} {dt^3} + ... \nonumber
\end{align}
where the subscript $p$ emphasizes that these are the \emph{predicted}
quantities of the positions, velocities, and accelerations at time $t_0 + \delta
t$ based on the known values at time $t_0$.

It is convenient to truncate the Taylor series in Eqs. \ref{eqA:Predictor} after
the acceleration term since the acceleration at time $t_0$ can be easily
calculated from the gradient of the potential energy function. Higher order
terms are difficult to compute, and contribute a significantly smaller amount as
the time step, $\delta t$, decreases. However, by truncating the Taylor
expansion we used an approximation that will introduce systematic error of our
predicted values calculated by Eqs. \ref{eqA:Predictor} compared to their
\emph{true} values. There is a way of approximating the magnitude of the
deviation of the predicted values from Eqs. \ref{eqA:Predictor}, however, that
will allow a correction to be applied to the integrated values.

As a reminder, the gradient of the potential was used to calculate the
forces---and therefore the acceleration---on each particle when making the
initial integration step from $t_0$. The acceleration may be calculated again
using the gradient of the potential at the predicted conformations:
\begin{equation}
   \bigtriangledown V\left[\vec{r}_p(t_0 + \delta t)\right] = m \vec{a}^{\prime}
   \label{eqA:ErrorCorrection}
\end{equation}
Since systematic error has been introduced by truncating the expansion in Eqs.
\ref{eqA:Predictor}, $\vec{a}^{\prime}$ from Eq. \ref{eqA:ErrorCorrection} and
$\vec{a}_p(t_0 + \delta t)$ from Eq. \ref{eqA:Predictor} will differ. The
magnitude of this difference can be used to correct the predicted values
according to Eqs. \ref{eqA:Corrector}.

\begin{align}
   \vec{r}_c(t + \delta t) & = \vec{r}_p(t + \delta t) + c_0 \Delta \vec{a}(t +
         \delta t) \nonumber \\
   \vec{v}_c(t + \delta t) & = \vec{v}_p(t + \delta t) + c_1 \Delta \vec{a}(t +
         \delta t)
   \label{eqA:Corrector} \\
   \vec{a}_c(t + \delta t) & = \vec{a}_p(t + \delta t) + c_2 \Delta \vec{a}(t +
         \delta t) \nonumber
\end{align}
where the subscripts indicate the relationship between the \emph{c}orrected and
\emph{p}redicted quantities, and the coefficients $c_0$, $c_1$, and $c_2$ are
parametrized to maximize performance, \cite{Gear1966, Gear1971} and have the
appropriate units to satisfy each equation. \cite{Allen_Tildesley} The corrector
process can be iterated until the desired level of agreement between the
predicted and corrected values is reached.

While the predictor-corrector algorithm allows long time steps to be taken by
fixing the resulting systematic error, the corrector step requires a full force
evaluation of the system at a set of coordinates, which is the most
time-consuming portion of the calculation. As a result, the corrector step is
computationally demanding, and predictor-corrector methods have been replaced by
other integration schemes in standard practice.

\subsection{Verlet Integrators}

Among the most popular types of integrators in common use today are based on the
\emph{Verlet} algorithms.
