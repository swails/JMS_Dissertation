This document is the official tutorial outlining the use and
implementation of the UF \LaTeX 2\ensuremath{\epsilon} template for
use on thesis and dissertations. The tutorial will cover the basic
files, commands, and syntax in order to properly implement the
template.  It should be made clear that this tutorial will not tell
one how to use \LaTeX 2\ensuremath{\epsilon}.  It will be assumed
that you will have had some previous knowledge or experience with
\LaTeX 2\ensuremath{\epsilon}, but, there are many aspects of publishing 
for the UF Graduate School that requires attention to some details that are 
normally not required in \LaTeX 2\ensuremath{\epsilon}.
