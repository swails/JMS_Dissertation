I would like to thank my parents, Mark and Mindy Swails, for their love,
guidance, and constant encouragement.

I thank my siblings, Kerri and Jeffrey Swails, for all the great times and their
(vain) attempts to keep me humble.

Thank you to my extended family for the incredible support system I've always
had growing up.

My friends in graduate school that provided a great deal of support and
comaraderie, and Adrian Roitberg provided guidance and instruction during my
graduate studies.

I also thank Quantum Theory Project for all the good times.

And finally, I would like to thank my wife, Roxy Lowry Swails, for everything.}
